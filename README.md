# NYPL-Tenable-Jira
An automated ticketing system that processes scan reports streamed from Tenable REST APIs, reduces the data via
nested dictionaries, and converts them into tickets through Jira REST APIs
- Processes scan data supplied from Tenable REST APIs and eliminates redundancies via nested dictionaries, then stores this information into a SQL database
- The data is grouped further based on a shared category, typically in scans, that would be the first word of an issue description; on some cases I would customize group names. This is up to your discretion. 
- CSV files 
- Grouped the data further based on a shared category and generated CSV files that captures all hosts pertaining to a
particular issue stemming from a common group via Python
â€¢ Built a ticketing system using Jira REST APIs that utilizes the grouped data and CSVs and produced a reduced ticket
load from several thousand to approximately a dozen per scan type via Python and SQL
